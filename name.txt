At this stage I am not an avid programmer however there are two things which I think make me stand apart from others.
1. I love to listen to other individuals opinions and perspective about new topics as well as things I consider myself to be well versed with. This is something that I believe helps me to efficiently and effectively contribute to a team project which I consider is am integral part of any club activity. Being able to listen to and discuss opinions with my peers helps me improvise my as well as their work which results in an overall better final product.
2. I am not the most hardworking person in this world but if there is something that I wish to accomplish or some project I am trying to complete, I commit to it with 100% dedication and am willing to do all that I must which helps my and my teams cause.
3. I am never shy to put in extra effort for my team, irrespective of my team members' level of motivation and dedication. This quality branches from the fact that I consider my project to be a representation of me as an individual and I am willing to put in maximal effort to uplift the status of my project.
